Java private static class:
A non-static nested class (sometimes incorrectly referred to as an 'inner class') 
has full access to the members of the class within which it is nested. 
A static nested class does not have a reference to a nesting instance, 
so a static nested class cannot invoke non-static methods or access non-static fields of an instance of 
the class within which it is nested.

Look at the LinkedPositionalList.java for ideas of inner class.
